'''14. Limitations of TensorFlow
Steep Learning Curve: TensorFlow has a steep learning curve, especially for beginners, due to its complexity and the need to understand concepts like computational graphs.

Verbosity: Writing TensorFlow code can be verbose, which may make it less intuitive compared to some higher-level libraries.

Community Support: While TensorFlow has a large and active community, certain issues may not have as much community support as some other machine learning libraries.
