15. Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning
Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input is associated with a corresponding output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, making it possible to predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given an unlabeled dataset and is tasked with finding patterns or relationships within the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning.
